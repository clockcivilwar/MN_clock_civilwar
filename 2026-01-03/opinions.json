        "reasoning": "January 3rd - another peaceful day. The confirmation hearings show a competent team ready to enforce immigration law. The voters have spoken, and in 17 days the new administration takes office. All the progressive posturing about 'resistance' is just rhetoric. When professional enforcement begins, most will comply.
