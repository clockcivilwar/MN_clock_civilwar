        "reasoning": "There are finally signs the administration is backing down - Bovino is leaving, Trump called Walz and promised changes. But I remain deeply skeptical. The DOJ subpoenas against Governor Walz and other officials show they're escalating the political war even as they pull back operationally. The Pretti killing has changed everything - even Second Amendment advocates are turning against ICE. We may be past the peak of physical confrontation, but the constitutional crisis continues.",

Critically, the investigation suggests the Pretti shooting may have been an accidental discharge - not the execution the media portrayed. The National Guard handing coffee to protesters shows remarkable restraint. The media continues to ignore how organized resistance creates these dangerous situations.",

The DOJ subpoenas against state officials for exercising their constitutional authority to criticize federal policy is outrageous overreach - criminalizing political speech. If the Pretti shooting was truly accidental, it raises even more serious questions about training, supervision, and rules of engagement. The legal case against this operation grows stronger daily.",
