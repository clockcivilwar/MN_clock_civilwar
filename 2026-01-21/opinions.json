They highlight the 5-year-old photo but don't mention the family was with criminal aliens. The 'protests' are organized by radical groups. Most Minnesotans support border security and immigration enforcement - they're just not out marching in subzero weather. The crisis narrative is manufactured.",

A 2-year-old was transferred to Texas in defiance of a court order - that's contempt. The Justice Department is subpoenaing elected officials for criticizing policy - a clear First Amendment violation. Pattern-and-practice Fourth Amendment violations are occurring daily.

However, the manner of enforcement - near schools, using tear gas affecting infants, defying court orders - strains legal limits. The DOJ subpoenas of state officials for political speech are constitutionally dubious. We're seeing levels of state-federal conflict not witnessed since desegregation.
