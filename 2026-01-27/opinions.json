Homan officially took over from Bovino and promised a 'more professional' approach. Most importantly, the DOJ agreed to pause the subpoenas against Governor Walz as part of the de-escalation agreement. But Alex Pretti is still dead. His family held a press conference demanding full accountability. The protests continue, though smaller. We're stepping back from the brink, but justice has not been served.",

The limited injunction on residential enforcement addresses the most inflammatory tactics while allowing commercial and targeted enforcement to continue. Homan's tone is notably different from Bovino's - more professional, less confrontational. The DOJ subpoena pause removes a major escalation point.

The court ruling allows commercial and targeted enforcement to continue - the core mission is intact. Homan will run operations better than Bovino did. The media will inevitably frame any compromise as a defeat for the administration, but that's not accurate. Enforcement continues, just with better optics. The activists didn't win; pragmatism won.",

The Fourth Amendment concerns about residential enforcement are addressed without invalidating federal immigration authority entirely.
