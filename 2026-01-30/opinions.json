      ],
      "reasoning": "From a progressive legislative standpoint, January 30 represents cautious de-escalation after the trauma of the previous weeks. The DOJ investigation continuing is the most important signal - the federal government is holding itself accountable. This isn't symbolic; civil rights investigations have led to real reforms in Ferguson, Minneapolis post-Floyd, and other jurisdictions.\n\nTom Homan's offer to draw down agents if Minnesota cooperates is a genuine diplomatic opening. While we can't accept terms that make local police do ICE's job, the fact that he's offering negotiation suggests federal recognition that the current approach is unsustainable. This is progress from the hard-line stance earlier.\n\nThe release of 5-year-old Liam Ramos after judicial intervention shows the courts are functioning to protect the most vulnerable. The Hopkins students detention and Columbia Heights 5-year-old case remain horrific, but the system responded when pushed.\n\nWhat gives me real hope is the cultural response. When Bruce Springsteen and Tom Morello play First Avenue, when 32 protest songs emerge, when thousands march after the concert - that's sustained, organized, creative resistance. The 'Streets of Minneapolis' movement echoes the civil rights era's cultural power. This isn't flash-in-pan outrage; it's building institutional memory.\n\nThe FBI investigation into protest funding concerns me from a civil liberties perspective, but Alpha News's framing feels like overreach. Organized protest requires resources - that's not conspiracy, it's how movements work. We need to be vigilant about surveillance overreach while maintaining our organizing infrastructure.\n\nI'm lowering my rating from 7 (yesterday) to 6 because the diplomatic opening from Homan, the DOJ investigation progressing, and the massive peaceful cultural resistance all point toward a sustainable pressure campaign rather than escalation to violence.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "As a journalist, I'm watching the narrative arc of this story shift from crisis to movement. The Springsteen/Tom Morello concert at First Avenue is historically significant - when major artists perform benefit concerts for a cause, it signals the issue has entered mainstream consciousness. The crowd of thousands marching afterward ('Streets of Minneapolis') isn't a riot; it's organized civil society.\n\nThe '32 protest songs inspired by Twin Cities ICE resistance' piece from MinnPost is culturally profound. We're witnessing real-time creation of movement anthems. This happened with civil rights ('We Shall Overcome'), anti-war ('Fortunate Son'), and now immigration resistance. Songs outlast the immediate crisis and become organizing tools for generations.\n\nThe human stories are breaking through in ways that change public opinion. 5-year-old Liam Ramos's release after judge intervention is the kind of story that shifts suburban moderates. The Woodbury man with rare skin condition 'scared to go out' after ICE detention humanizes the fear. The father detained while his disabled son dies (Maher Tarabishi story) is heartbreaking and cuts through political abstractions.\n\nWhat I find most encouraging: the resistance is professionalizing rather than radicalizing. The Immigrant Defense Network's statewide constitutional observer training is legal organizing, not militant activity. The restaurant industry's Congressional lobbying is economic power being deployed strategically. This suggests a long-term campaign with institutional backing.\n\nThe Don Lemon arrest is concerning for press freedom, but CNN's vigorous defense and the backlash it generated may actually strengthen protections. When mainstream media companies defend their journalists, it sets precedent.\n\nI'm rating this 5, down from 6 yesterday, because the movement is consolidating gains and building infrastructure rather than escalating confrontation.

      ],
      "reasoning": "From a civil rights litigation perspective, January 30 shows the legal infrastructure is not just functioning but prevailing in key battles. The federal judge ordering the release of 5-year-old Liam Ramos and his father within 3 days is exactly the judicial intervention we've been seeking. This sets precedent for future cases involving children and establishes that courts will review detention decisions even during enforcement surges.\n\nThe order for ICE director Todd Lyons to appear personally in court is extraordinary. Federal judges don't issue such orders lightly - it suggests the court has found ICE's non-compliance with previous orders to be willful or egregious. This is the judiciary asserting its co-equal branch authority. If Lyons fails to appear or comply, contempt sanctions could follow, which would be a major constitutional moment.\n\nThe DOJ Civil Rights Division investigation into Alex Pretti's death is proceeding methodically. These investigations typically take months, but the fact it's been opened while enforcement continues shows federal executive branch internal accountability. This is pattern-and-practice investigation authority that has reformed entire police departments.\n\nWhat's remarkable is the scale of legal mobilization: 20 habeas corpus petitions in one Saturday. That's not individual attorneys working alone - that's a coordinated network including law schools, legal aid organizations, private firms doing pro bono, immigration clinics. This level of mobilization is sustainable and suggests we can maintain legal pressure indefinitely.\n\nICE's admission of submitting inaccurate information to a federal judge in the Long Island case is devastating to their credibility. Every ICE declaration, detention justification, and sworn statement is now impeachable. Defense attorneys will cite this admission in every case. This is a systemic litigation advantage.\n\nI'm rating this 5, down from 6 yesterday, because the legal system is demonstrating it can constrain federal enforcement through judicial review, habeas corpus, and civil rights investigations without requiring extralegal resistance.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "As a progressive economist, I'm analyzing the January 30 economic landscape through the lens of labor market adjustments and business community mobilization. The 'ICE Out' business shutdown is economically significant not because of the one-day revenue loss, but because it represents businesses using economic power as political leverage. When employers voluntarily close to protest federal policy, they're signaling that the current enforcement regime threatens their long-term viability more than one day of lost revenue.\n\nThe restaurant industry's letters to Congress are particularly important. Restaurants operate on razor-thin margins (3-5% net profit typically), so their willingness to engage in political advocacy despite potential customer backlash indicates existential concern. They're not just saying 'we need immigrant labor' - they're arguing the current enforcement approach will destroy their industry.\n\nThe healthcare sector impacts are becoming quantifiable. Medical residents' testimony about 'constant anxiety' and 'public health crisis' can be translated into economic costs: reduced productivity, increased errors, worker burnout and turnover, shift from preventive to emergency care (much more expensive). The infant who lost consciousness from tear gas exposure will have lifetime healthcare costs potentially exceeding $1 million, borne largely by public programs.\n\nWhat's encouraging from an economic perspective: the Sahan Journal reporting on workers and employers 'navigating increasingly complex relationship' suggests adaptive behaviors are emerging. Employers are finding ways to protect workers, workers are finding ways to stay employed. Markets adapt. This isn't optimal, but it's not economic collapse.\n\nThe food producers' 'lunch-and-learn' event indicates industry-wide coordination and knowledge-sharing. When industries organize collectively around policy issues, they become effective lobbying forces. This is how economic interests translate into political outcomes in a democracy.\n\nI'm rating this 5, down from 6 yesterday, because the business community is organizing effectively and the economy is adapting rather than collapsing.

      ],
      "reasoning": "As a moderate senator seeking bipartisan solutions, January 30 presents both opportunities and persistent dangers. Tom Homan's offer to draw down agents if Minnesota cooperates is the most significant diplomatic opening we've seen. This creates a negotiation framework. However, the details matter enormously: if 'cooperation' means state and local police becoming ICE deputies, that's politically impossible for DFL leadership and violates principles of community policing. If it means simply not actively obstructing federal operations, there might be middle ground.\n\nThe judge's decision refusing to halt enforcement is legally defensible but practically problematic. Two civilians are dead (Renee Good, Alex Pretti), and enforcement continues while deaths remain under investigation. The DOJ investigation is appropriate, but it's slow-moving accountability that doesn't prevent the next incident. We need real-time safeguards, not post-hoc reviews.\n\nThe new videos showing Alex Pretti in a 'scuffle' with federal officers 11 days before his death are deeply troubling. If ICE targeted him for previous confrontation, that's escalation that could have been prevented through de-escalation protocols. The pattern suggests individual officers or units may be acting with personal animus rather than professional detachment.\n\nThe ICE claim about the detainee shattering his skull by running into a wall is generating 'tension at Minneapolis hospital' according to Pioneer Press. Healthcare workers don't believe it. When law enforcement loses credibility with healthcare professionals - who are trained to assess injuries - that's a systemic trust breakdown that affects future interactions.\n\nWhat gives me hope: the protests after the Springsteen concert were massive but peaceful. Thousands marching through downtown Minneapolis, but no violence, no property destruction. That's organized, disciplined civil society operating within democratic norms. The 'Streets of Minneapolis' framing evokes civil rights movement nonviolence.\n\nI'm maintaining a rating of 7 (same as yesterday) because while diplomatic pathways exist, the fundamental issues - ongoing enforcement, civilian deaths, credibility crisis - remain unresolved. We're in severe tension without clear de-escalation.",

      "reasoning": "As a senior editor assessing coverage quality, January 30 reveals both excellent journalism and significant verification challenges. Sahan Journal's systematic survey of all 112 Republican legislators asking about the Good and Pretti killings is exemplary accountability journalism. The fact that most declined comment is itself newsworthy - it suggests either political calculation to avoid the issue, or genuine uncertainty about how to respond. Either way, the public deserves to know which elected officials will/won't address civilian deaths.\n\nThe new videos showing Alex Pretti in a 'scuffle' with federal officers 11 days before his death add important context, but responsible editors must ask: who released these videos? What's the chain of custody? Are they complete or edited? What was the legal basis for the initial encounter? Without answers, we're just amplifying partial information that confirms different audiences' priors.\n\nThe ICE claim about the detainee shattering his skull by running into a wall is being reported widely, but with appropriate skepticism. Pioneer Press headline captures this: 'ICE claim...triggers tension at Minneapolis hospital.' The claim is sourced to ICE, but medical professionals doubt it. Good journalism reports the claim while noting the dispute, without pretending to adjudicate medical questions beyond our expertise.\n\nThe AP meta-story about Star Tribune covering this 'all-encompassing story' during 'digital transition' is important. Local journalism is under resource strain everywhere, and this story requires intensive coverage across beats: immigration, law enforcement, courts, politics, business, healthcare, education. The Star Tribune showing no search results in our extraction suggests paywall issues or search functionality problems - either way, a major metro daily being invisible in the data is concerning.\n\nAmerican Experiment's claim of '20 habeas corpus cases filed in one day' appears in their reporting but I haven't seen independent verification from other sources. That's either a coordination failure across newsrooms (we should all be tracking this) or a claim that needs more sourcing.\n\nI'm maintaining a 7 rating because the journalism is functioning - investigations happening, accountability questions being asked - but the factual landscape remains contested and institutional pressures on newsrooms are showing.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "From a constitutional law perspective, January 30 demonstrates the checking-and-balancing functions of our system operating under extreme stress. The judge ordering ICE director Todd Lyons to appear personally in court for non-compliance is significant - it's the judicial branch asserting Article III authority over Article II executive agencies. If Lyons defies the order, the court has contempt powers. This is the kind of inter-branch tension the Framers anticipated and designed the system to handle.\n\nThe judge's decision refusing preliminary injunction while allowing the lawsuit to proceed is jurisprudentially sound. Courts are extremely reluctant to enjoin federal immigration enforcement given the plenary power doctrine established in the Chinese Exclusion Case (1889) and progeny. However, courts absolutely have authority to review whether enforcement methods violate constitutional rights (Fourth Amendment search/seizure, Fifth Amendment due process, First Amendment assembly). The lawsuit proceeding on the merits allows discovery, evidence gathering, and eventual judicial determination without the court prematurely substituting its judgment for the executive's.\n\nThe DOJ Civil Rights Division investigating ICE/DHS is constitutionally interesting because it's executive investigating executive. Normally, we think of checks as inter-branch (Congress checking President, Courts checking Congress). But the executive branch has internal checks: DOJ maintains independence from other agencies, Inspectors General provide oversight, Civil Rights Division can investigate civil rights violations even by federal officers. This is intra-branch accountability that supplements inter-branch checks.\n\nBorder czar Homan's offer to 'draw down' agents if Minnesota cooperates is politically significant and constitutionally revealing. It suggests the executive branch recognizes that while it has legal authority to enforce immigration law, political and practical limits exist. This is federalism working through negotiation rather than litigation - the system allowing political compromise before constitutional crisis.\n\nThe habeas corpus cases (20 in one day) show the Great Writ operating at the scale the Framers envisioned during emergencies. Article I, Section 9 prohibits suspension of habeas except 'when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.' No one is claiming rebellion or invasion, so habeas remains available, and courts are hearing cases. This is the Constitution's emergency safety valve operating correctly.\n\nI maintain a 7 rating because while constitutional mechanisms are functioning, the deaths of civilians during federal enforcement operations represent potential constitutional violations (excessive force, denial of due process) that haven't been adjudicated. The system is working, but working slowly while risks persist.",

      "reasoning": "As a regional economist, I'm analyzing Minnesota's economy through labor market indicators, business confidence measures, and structural stability. January 30 shows an economy under significant stress but adapting through collective action rather than collapsing through individual panic.\n\nThe 'ICE Out' business shutdown is economically revealing. When businesses coordinate to close voluntarily for political protest, they're signaling two things: (1) they believe current enforcement threatens long-term viability more than one-day revenue loss, and (2) they have sufficient economic resources to absorb short-term costs for long-term strategic positioning. This is rational economic behavior, not desperation.\n\nThe restaurant industry's letters to Congress represent industry-level political economy strategy. Restaurants are organizing collectively to change policy rather than individually adapting to policy constraints. This suggests they believe the current equilibrium is unsustainable and political intervention is needed. When industries lobby this aggressively, it often precedes policy shifts - the business community is a powerful political force.\n\nThe healthcare sector impacts are economically quantifiable now. Medical residents reporting 'constant anxiety' and 'public health crisis' translates to: reduced productivity (anxious workers less efficient), increased errors (stress impairs judgment), accelerated burnout and turnover (replacement costs), and shift from preventive to emergency care (emergency room visits 3-5x more expensive than preventive care). These costs accumulate and will show up in Minnesota's healthcare spending data within quarters.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney resignations have an underappreciated economic dimension. Federal prosecutors handle fraud cases, white-collar crime, public corruption - all things that affect business climate quality. If prosecutions slow because experienced prosecutors have resigned, deterrent effects weaken. The Dr. Oz visit to Griggs-Midway fraud site mentioned in coverage suggests major fraud issues in Minnesota that need prosecutorial attention.\n\nSahan Journal's reporting on workers and employers 'navigating increasingly complex relationship' reveals micro-level market adaptations. Employers are finding ways to protect workers (providing legal resources, adjusting schedules, avoiding certain locations). Workers are adjusting behaviors (varying routes, avoiding certain times/places). These adaptations have economic costs (inefficiency, reduced productivity) but they're market responses that maintain some economic activity.\n\nI maintain a 7 rating because the economic disruption is significant and measurable, but the economy is responding through organization and adaptation rather than collapse.

      ],
      "reasoning": "As a conservative legislator, I am increasingly convinced we are witnessing a coordinated insurrection against federal law enforcement, and January 30 represents escalation rather than de-escalation. The violent attacks on federal officers and facilities are the evidence: a criminal ramming an ICE vehicle, anti-ICE 'rioters' (Alpha News's characterization) attacking a hotel housing federal officers. When law enforcement officers cannot safely stay in hotels, we've crossed into insurgency.\n\nGovernor Walz's comparison of ICE agents to Nazi occupation and Anne Frank is the most dangerous rhetoric I've ever heard from a Minnesota governor. He is explicitly comparing federal law enforcement officers, enforcing duly passed laws, to the perpetrators of genocide. This is not political hyperbole - it's incitement. When a governor tells citizens their situation is equivalent to Holocaust victims hiding from Nazis, he is morally authorizing violent resistance. The blood of the next federal officer injured or killed will be on his hands.\n\nFBI Director Patel's confirmation of investigations into Signal chats and organized funding is the smoking gun. This is not organic protest - it's coordinated, funded, organized illegal activity. The Signal chats likely contain evidence of conspiracy to obstruct federal officers, which is a federal felony. The funding sources need to be exposed and prosecuted. This is exactly how insurgencies operate: external funding, encrypted communications, cells of operatives.\n\nThe federal judge's ruling refusing to halt enforcement is legally correct - federal plenary power over immigration is settled constitutional law. Yet despite this ruling, thousands marched after the Bruce Springsteen concert. When court decisions are ignored by masses of protesters, the rule of law has collapsed. We're in a situation where legal authority exists on paper but not in practice.\n\nMost damning: Border czar Homan offered to draw down agents if Minnesota cooperates. This is a diplomatic off-ramp. DFL leadership's response has been silence or rejection. They are choosing confrontation when resolution is available. This proves their goal is not public safety or de-escalation - it's political theater and resistance for its own sake.\n\nSahan Journal's survey showing most Republican legislators declining comment on the Good/Pretti deaths is portrayed as cowardice, but it's actually prudence. We've seen what happens when conservatives speak in this environment - they're targeted, doxxed, threatened. The mob has created conditions where elected officials cannot speak freely. That's tyranny.\n\nI rate this 10, not 11-12, only because the National Guard has not been activated and federal law enforcement is still operational. But we are one major incident - one federal officer killed, one mass casualty event during a protest - away from the Governor invoking emergency powers or the President invoking the Insurrection Act.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "As a conservative commentator, January 30 reveals the full extent of coordinated media bias designed to delegitimize federal law enforcement and paint criminals as victims. The coverage of the Bruce Springsteen/Tom Morello concert is illustrative: mainstream outlets (Pioneer Press, MinnPost) cover it as a cultural event, a 'benefit concert,' with glowing reviews. They don't ask: what are these celebrities benefiting? They're raising money for organizations that obstruct federal law enforcement. That's material support for illegal activity, but media treats it like a charity fundraiser.\n\nMinnPost's piece on '32 protest songs inspired by Twin Cities ICE resistance' is propaganda disguised as arts coverage. They're treating resistance to federal law enforcement as equivalent to the civil rights movement, complete with movement anthems. The civil rights movement fought against unjust laws - segregation violated the Constitution. Immigration enforcement upholds constitutional federal authority. The comparison is obscene, but mainstream media promotes it uncritically.\n\nThe SNL cold open, Grammy protests, Lady Gaga's Tokyo concert rant - this is coordinated Hollywood elite messaging within a 48-hour period. When did they all decide to make ICE their cause? This doesn't happen organically. There's coordination, likely involving the same activist groups FBI is investigating. But mainstream media covers each incident as individual celebrity expression, not a coordinated campaign.\n\nThe most damning media bias: FBI Director Patel's confirmation of investigations into Signal chats and organized funding should be front-page news. It's the biggest story - federal law enforcement has evidence of coordinated illegal activity. Yet CNN, PBS, AP barely mention it. Only Alpha News, Fox, conservative outlets feature it prominently. That's editorial bias - deciding which facts matter based on political alignment.\n\nThe Liam Ramos story is framed entirely as ICE cruelty: '5-year-old detained.' But the relevant question no mainstream outlet asks: what crimes did his father commit that made him removable? Was he previously deported and illegally re-entered? Does he have violent criminal history? These aren't irrelevant details - they're central to understanding whether ICE acted appropriately. Media frames it as random cruelty.\n\nWhat's most alarming: this media bias is working. When Springsteen, SNL, Grammys, and 'resistance art' all echo the same message within days, it shifts public opinion. Fox News polls showing ICE disapproval nationally suggests the propaganda campaign is effective. The silent majority may be turning into a vocal anti-enforcement majority.\n\nI rate this 10 because media-driven delegitimization of law enforcement historically precedes violence. When society is told that law enforcement are Nazis (Walz), that resistance is moral duty (celebrities), and that obstruction is heroic (protest songs), violence becomes justified in protesters' minds.",

        "Don Lemon church arrest: if inside illegally occupied building, journalism is not defense to criminal trespass or obstruction"
      ],
      "reasoning": "As a former federal prosecutor, I analyze January 30 through the lens of federal criminal statutes and prosecutorial discretion. The judge's decision refusing to enjoin immigration enforcement is legally correct and based on well-established precedent. Federal plenary power over immigration dates to the Chinese Exclusion Case (1889) and has been consistently affirmed. States have no authority to nullify federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit can proceed to challenge specific constitutional violations (Fourth Amendment, excessive force), but cannot halt enforcement categorically.\n\nThe habeas corpus flood - 20 cases in one Saturday - is lawfare designed to burden the system. While habeas is a constitutional right, coordinated mass filing by the same legal networks (as American Experiment reports) suggests strategic litigation to create administrative paralysis. Each petition requires ICE response, government attorneys, judicial resources. If attorneys are filing frivolous petitions to delay lawful removals, that approaches abuse of process. DOJ should review these petitions for patterns of frivolous filing.\n\nThe criminal ramming of an ICE vehicle is 18 USC 111 - assault on a federal officer. If a vehicle is used, that's a deadly weapon, elevating it to aggravated assault with potential 20-year sentence. This should be vigorously prosecuted. The hotel attack reported by Alpha News - 'anti-ICE rioters violently attack Minneapolis hotel' - could be charged as conspiracy to assault federal officers (18 USC 372), with RICO predicates if organized groups are involved.\n\nThe Don Lemon arrest situation requires factual clarity: if he was on public property documenting events, arrest violates press freedom. If he was inside an illegally occupied church building where protesters had blocked childcare stairwells (as court filings reportedly show), then he was participating in illegal activity. Journalism doesn't grant immunity from trespass, obstruction, or child endangerment laws. The prosecution should proceed based on evidence, not his celebrity status.\n\nWhat concerns me most prosecutorially: the resignation of multiple federal prosecutors from Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office. These are career professionals with ethical obligations to enforce federal law regardless of personal views. Their resignations suggest either: (1) they believe current enforcement violates legal or ethical standards, or (2) they're prioritizing political preferences over professional duties. Either scenario is troubling. If (1), there should be whistleblower reports detailing legal violations. If (2), they've abandoned their oaths.\n\nThe FBI investigation into Signal chats and organized funding is the critical prosecutorial focus. If evidence shows conspiracy to obstruct federal officers (18 USC 372), material support for illegal activity, or coordination to harbor removable aliens (8 USC 1324), criminal prosecutions should follow. The encryption suggests consciousness of guilt - people using Signal know they're discussing illegal activity.\n\nI rate this 9, not 10, because federal courts are still functioning and prosecutions can proceed. But the level of organized resistance, violent attacks on federal officers, and state officials' rhetoric (Walz comparing ICE to Nazis) create conditions for escalation.",

      "reasoning": "As a free-market economist, I analyze the Minnesota situation through cost-benefit analysis, labor market effects, and rule of law's role in economic efficiency. January 30 reveals severe economic distortions from both illegal immigration and the enforcement response.\n\nThe business shutdown for 'ICE Out' is economically inefficient - it's pure deadweight loss. Businesses close, lose revenue, but no one captures that value. It's just destroyed productivity. From a signaling perspective, businesses are revealing their preference: they value political positioning over profit maximization. That's either virtue signaling (subsidized by profits from other days) or genuine belief that current enforcement threatens their business model. If the latter, it reveals dangerous structural dependency.\n\nThe restaurant industry's lobbying for immigration 'reform' (i.e., maintaining current labor access) exposes their business model's vulnerability. If restaurants can only operate profitably by employing potentially unauthorized workers at below-market wages, that's an unsustainable business model propped up by non-enforcement. True market-clearing wages in hospitality would be higher, which might reduce restaurant industry size but increase worker welfare. The industry is essentially lobbying for regulatory forbearance that allows wage suppression.\n\nThe healthcare costs are substantial and taxpayer-funded. The infant who lost consciousness from tear gas exposure will have lifetime developmental and healthcare costs potentially exceeding $1 million, borne largely by Minnesota's public healthcare programs. Medical residents reporting 'constant anxiety' and 'public health crisis' translates to reduced productivity and increased medical errors, both economically costly. The shift from preventive to emergency care (because immigrants avoiding hospitals) is economically inefficient - emergency care is 3-5x more expensive than preventive care, and taxpayers bear the cost via emergency Medicaid.\n\nDr. Oz's visit to the Griggs-Midway fraud site is significant but underreported. As CMS administrator, he oversees Medicare/Medicaid. If massive fraud is occurring in Minnesota (as American Experiment's coverage suggests), and if that fraud is connected to immigration issues (document fraud, identity theft, benefits fraud), then the fiscal costs of illegal immigration are far higher than commonly reported. Federal prosecutors' resignations may slow these fraud investigations, reducing deterrent effects.\n\nMost fundamentally: rule of law is essential for business environment quality. When law enforcement officers can't safely operate (hotels attacked, vehicles rammed), when state governors compare federal law to Nazi occupation, when courts can't enforce orders - this creates massive uncertainty. Businesses need predictable legal frameworks, contract enforcement, property rights protection. All of these depend on functioning rule of law. If Minnesota becomes a jurisdiction where federal law can be nullified by state/local action, what confidence do businesses have that other laws (tax, labor, environmental) will be enforced consistently?\n\nI rate this 9 because the economic uncertainty from rule-of-law breakdown is reaching critical levels. Capital is mobile - if Minnesota becomes 'the resistance state,' businesses will locate elsewhere.",
