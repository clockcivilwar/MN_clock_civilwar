        "reasoning": "Saturday brought the largest protest yet - estimates of 15,000 or more marching through Minneapolis for Renee Good. The weekend allowed working people to join. Solidarity protests are emerging in St. Paul, Duluth, and cities outside Minnesota. Federal authorities have refused calls for an enforcement pause during the investigation.

The question of who's funding and organizing these massive protests isn't being asked. Reports of out-of-state vehicles and professional organizers aren't being investigated.
